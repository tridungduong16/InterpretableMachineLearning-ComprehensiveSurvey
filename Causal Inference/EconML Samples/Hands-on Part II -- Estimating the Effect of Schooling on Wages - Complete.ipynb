    "To measure true causal effects of a treatment $T$ on an outcome $Y$ from observational data, we need to record all features $X$ that might influence both $T$ and $Y$. These $X$'s are called confounders. \n",
    "\n",
    "When some confounders are not recorded in the data, we might get biased estimates of the treatment effect. Here is an example:\n",
    "* Children of high-income parents might attain higher levels of education (e.g. college) since they can afford it\n",
    "* Children of high-income parents might also obtain better paying jobs due to parents' connections and knowledge\n",
    "* At first sight, it might appear as if education has an effect on income, when in fact this could be fully explained by family background\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons for not recording all possible confounders, such as incomplete data or a confounder that is difficult to quantify (e.g. parental involvement). However, not all is lost! In cases such as these, we can use instrumental variables $Z$, features that affect the outcome only through their effect on the treatment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use a real-world problem to show how treatment effects can be extracted with the help of instrumental variables. "

    "The **causal impact of schooling on wages** had been studied at length. Although it is generally agreed that there is a positive impact, it is difficult to measure this effect precisely. The core problem is that education levels are not assigned at random in the population and we cannot record all possible confounders. (Think about the value parents assign to education. How would you quantify how valuable parents think their children's education is?). \n",

    "\n",
    "To get around this issue, we can use **proximity to a 4-year college** as an instrumental variable. Having a college nearby can allow individuals (especially low-income ones) to complete more years of education. Hence, if there was a positive treatment effect, we would expect these individuals to have higher wages on average. Note that college proximity is a valid IV since it does not affect wages directly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men (NLSYM, 1966) to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) of education on wages (see also [Card, 1999](https://www.nber.org/papers/w4483)). The NLSYM data contains entries from men ages 14-24 that were interviewed in 1966 and again in 1976. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains the following variables:\n",
    "* $Y$ (outcome): wages (log)\n",
    "* $T$ (treatment): years of schooling\n",
    "* $Z$ (IV): proximity to a 4-year college (binary)\n",
    "* $X$ (heterogeneity): e.g. parental education\n",
    "* $W$ (controls): e.g. family composition, location, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The world can then be modelled as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "Y & = \\theta(X) \\cdot T + f(W) + \\epsilon\\\\\n",
    "T & = g(Z, W) + \\eta\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
